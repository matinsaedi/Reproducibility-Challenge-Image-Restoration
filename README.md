## ✅ Project Summary
With recent developments in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, **Image restoration** has become a trending topic in the field. However, most of the proposed methods for image restoration tasks deploy complex architectures as their base models. The paper we selected proposes a simple yet computationally efficient baseline that outperforms several similar, more complex models. Additionally, it shows that common non-linear activation functions—such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Softmax—can be replaced by simple multiplication operations or even removed, introducing a **Nonlinear Activation-Free Network (NAFNet)**. Following the original paper's methodology, we reproduced the models and trained them on two public datasets: GoPro (for image deblurring) and SIDD (for image denoising), achieving peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNR) of **30.83 dB** and **39.32 dB**, respectively.

## ✅ Our Contribution

We reproduced the original paper's models and training pipelines using **PyTorch**, and evaluated them on two public datasets:

## GoPro Dataset

| Model  | Baseline (Paper) | NAFNet (Paper) | Baseline (Ours)  | NAFNet (Ours)  |
|--------|------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| PSNR   | 33.40            | 33.69          | 30.29            | 30.83          |
| SSIM   | 0.965            | 0.967          | 0.89             | 0.90           |


## SIDD Dataset

| Model  | Baseline (Paper) | NAFNet (Paper) | Baseline (Ours)  | NAFNet (Ours)  |
|--------|------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| PSNR   | 40.30            | 40.30          | 39.24            | 39.32          |
| SSIM   | 0.962            | 0.962          | 0.92             | 0.92           |

 ## ✅ Instructions
 Make sure you have the following versions installed:
 - Python 3.11.0
 - CUDA 12.6 drivers (for GPU acceleration)

**1. Dependencies:**
   
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 This project uses PyTorch with GPU (CUDA 12.6). If you want to use the GPU version, install it using the following command:
